                 Here is my first design attempt for the Skateboarding CARP Poster,
                 it makes use of proximity to create a clear visual hierachy, with relevant and similar
                 information being grouped together and aligned, to make it structured and the 
                 text and key information easy to read. I also attempted
                 to implement colour contrast between the brighter, white text, and the darker 
                 black text, which helps to create a vibrant and visually pleasing 
                 design. This is balanced out through the use of a purple outline
                 which is complementary of the blackbackground, creating an aesthetially pleasing use 
                 of colour. <br>
                 However, the design is not dynamic enough, as it is too structured and doesn't feature
                 enough visually interesting graphical elements, or feature an interesting use of text. 
                 This creates a clean design but one that isn't visually interesting or chaotic 
                 enough for the theme of skateboarding, which is fast based and dynamic.

                Here is my second design attempt for the Skateboarding CARP Poster, it similarly to my first design
                makes use of proximity to create clear visual hierachy between similar information. 
                This can be seen through the Title, key image and key information being 
                centred, creating a neat, clean and visulally interesting design. I also made use 
                of colour contrast again with the bright white text contrasting well with the darker black
                background, this time with a pink outline to complement the black. I attempted to add more dynamic 
                and visually interesting graphical elements to this design with the company poster being aligned directly
                under the image of a lady skateboarding, making it look like she is reaching out and touching
                the logo, which did add some much needed dynamism to the design.
                <br>
                However, the text is still too structured and orderly, which didn't fit with 
                the fast paced and chaotic nature of skateboarding.

                 Here is my third and final design attempt for the Skateboarding Carp Poster, while it 
                 is similar to my previous two designs in some aspects such as the use of 
                 brighter white text on a darker background to create effective colour contrast
                 with a pink outline to complement the black, it is far more visually interesting and dynamic
                 as it utilises the text far more to create a design that evokes fun and 
                 adrenalin, something that skateboarding is renowned for. This is as the 
                 text utilises the axial typographic system 
                 and is diagonally aligned along a white line, with interesting graphical elements such
                 as the image of a girl skateboarding, highlighted in pink, 
                 breaking across this axial design to demonstrate the chaotic nature of skateboarding
                 and emphasising the skateboarding focus with the company logo and the image
                 being the standout elements of the poster.

            <p class="text-caption-big-CARP"> CARP Project InDesign Skateboard Poster Design 3- Final Design Further Details <br> <br>
                In my final design for the Skateboarding CARP Poster, I really focused on trying to make 
                the overall poster design far more visually interesting and chaotic to match
                the unstable nature of skateboarding as my previous two designs, while they were clean
                and sleek, where too safe and structured, and didn't capture the feel and spirit of 
                skateboarding too well. In order to achieve a more intersting design I wanted to make use of the text, using 
                the axial typographic system and aligning my text diagonally, with key information
                such as the title, on the right side of the page in large text and hte finer details 
                in smaller text on the left side of the page. I also took the image of 
                the lady skateboarding into photoshop and removed the backgroun and placed 
                a pink fill on her, which helped her contrast far better with the dark black background, which 
                really helped her standout on the page and emphasise the skateboarding theme further. 
                I then placed this image and the company logo, along the whnite diagonal line 
                having them break through to the other side of the page, which helped emphasise
                the skateboarding focus of the poster design.
