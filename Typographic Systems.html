            Here is my Axial Typographic System Design, it features
            a diagonal white line dividing the canvas into two clear sides
            with text diagonally aligned either side with the contrasting
            colours of pink and black emphasising this divide. I have chosen the 
            Futura PT typeface as it is clean and easy to read, whilst 
            providing a clean and sleek design.

             Here is my Grid Typographic System Design, it features neatly aligned
             text in the Futura PT typeface that is contained within aligned 
             rectangles and boxes, forming a grid typographic system that also 
             looks fun an dynamic whilst keeping the structured appearance 
             typically associated with the grid typographic system.

            Here is my Radial Typographic System Design, it features a pink circle
            with the title text inside in the Futura PT typeface with all the remaining text 
            radiating out from the centre of the circle, creating a dynamic and visually appealign 
            radial typographic system design that remains easy to read despite the more complex
            typographic system.

            Here is my Dilatational Typographic System Design, it features text in 
            the Futura PT typeface mapped over a circle, using the type on a path tool in illustrator.
            It creates a dynamic and fun design with the text at the bottom of the page
            making the shape of eyes, which adds an effective visual element to the design, 
            albeit with the text hard to read.

                the Futura PT typeface contained using shapes such as circles and rectangles
                which help to give the centred bilateral design some visually interesting elements,

                Here is my Random Typographic System Design, it features text in the 
                Futura PT Typeface contained by an array of different shapes, with
                 the largest shape on the left of the page containing the title, being 
                 created with the illustrator, shape building tool. Overall it creates
                 a dynamic and somewhat chaotic design that is visually interesting.

                Here is my Modular Typographic System Design, it features the Futura PT 
                typeface, contained using different sized pink circles that create 
                a visually interesting, bubble appearance with text being neatly displayed
                inside, which also helps to create clear visual hierachy with the 2 circles
                at the top of the page, containing the title and key information being positioned

                Here is my Transitional Typographic System Design, it features pink text in 
                the Futura PT typeface that, using illustrator's type on a path tool, 
                has the appearance of being curved and almost wavelike. Whilst the text is 
                slightly harder to read, the transitional typographic system provides a dynamic and
                unique design as the very nature of it allows for the text to become a visual element, 
                creating an interesting and effective design
