        For the Graphic and Web Design Studio, Design Fundamentals Website Project we were tasked with 
        creating a flexbox website using HTML and CSS to contain our project pieces, which include the completed Coding Worksheets project with
        links to their respective GitHub pages, the Contrast, Alignment, Repetition and Proximity Skateboarding Poster Project and the Typography Project featuring an illustrator design
        for 8 unique typographic systems. 
         <br> <br>

        I am overall pleased with my completion of the design fundamentals website project as my flexbox website successfully flexes in relation to the screen and window size, displaying
        all content in its correct and intended order without breaking or becoming disordered. I have achieved this through the implementation of flexbox containers that force the content
        to flex whenever the window size is largened or decreased. I am also pleased with the successful implementation of navigation throughout my flexbox website, with my fully functioning navigation bar
        providing simple and easy to understand links to each page. I have also implemented anchor links into my flexbox website, which provides another form of navigation and allows for users to jump from the footer back to the
        navbar, demonstrating a successful implementation of multiple forms of navigation. However, there are some ways in which I could improve my website, such as ensuring that the images used on my homepage remain high quality
        even when the website is flexed, as if the window becomes larger, my homepage images become increasingly distorted. 
        <br> <br>

        Overall, I am also pleased with my completion of the Typography Project, with my 8 typographic system designs featuring effective use of the complementary colours, pink and black as well as the clean, easy to read and sleek
        typeface of Futura PT. I am particularly happy with my designs for the Radial and Transitional typographic systems as I feel the text creates visually interesting and dynamic graphical elements that are aesthetically pleasing. However, for some 
        of my typographic system designs such as the Dilatational design, whilst they are visually interesting with the text forming a graphical element, the text is difficult to follow and read, so more consideration for the overall readability of the text would
        have improved my design for the Dilatational typographic system.
        <br> <br>

        I am also pleased overall with my completion of the CARP Skateboarding Poster Project, with my final design featuring good colour contrast between the brighter white text and the darker black background and a good balance between text readability and a dynamic
        and fun design, that captures the chaos and unstable nature of skateboarding well. However, my first two initial designs for the CARP Project, were too stable and neat, with not enough visually interesting or dynamic graphical elements. I improved this for my final
        design as it makes use of the axial typographic system to make the text far more dynamic. For my final design I also removed the background of the image of a lady skateboarding and gave her a pink fill, helping her contrast well with the black background, and positioned her on the diagonal white line. 
        This helps add the dynamic and unstable feel as the image breaks across the page, becoming the focal point of the design in the process.
